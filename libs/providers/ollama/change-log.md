- refactor!: restructure core and providers packages and APIs
- - move core into `libs/core` and providers into `libs/providers/ollama`
- rename multiple modules/types (models→types, prompts/utils→format, tools utils)
- merge structured_tools into llms and rename StructuredLLM to StructuredOutputLLM
- update build config, CI, docs, and tests for new layout
- BREAKING CHANGE: public import paths and several module/class names were renamed or relocated; update imports to the new libs-based structure.

- feat(core): implement initial core architecture and foundational LLM utility features (#3)
- **feat(core): implement initial core architecture and foundational LLM utility features**
- - Design and implement core modules for LLM orchestration, function conversion, prompt validation, and tool execution
- Introduce key classes: FunctionConverter, SyncAsyncConverter, ToolExecutor, ToolCallArguments, Docstring, Schema, ArgumentCoercer, StreamingObjectProcessor, MessageList, and FlexibleModel
- Establish foundational LLM abstractions: BaseLLM, FunctionCallingLLM, ToolOrchestratingLLM, TextCompletionLLM, and related parser classes
- Provide robust support for synchronous/asynchronous function handling, tool calling, argument coercion, and schema validation
- Integrate comprehensive unit and integration tests for all major components and workflows
- Add extensive documentation, architecture diagrams, and usage examples for core modules and LLM integration
- Configure project metadata, dependencies (`numpy`, `filetype`, `requests`), and development workflows for Python 3.11/3.12 compatibility
- Set up modern packaging, namespace structure, and CI/CD with uv and mkdocs for documentation

- **Package Insights:**
- The `serapeum-core` package is designed as a utility library for LLM-based applications, supporting generative AI, chatbots, RAG, and NLP workflows.
- It provides a modular, extensible foundation for building, orchestrating, and testing LLM-driven tools and pipelines.
- The architecture is production-ready, with robust testing, documentation, and modern Python packaging best practices.
